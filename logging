EFK (ELASTIC SEARCH + FLUENTBIT + KIBANA)

SO we have deployed fluntbit as daemonset in each node which besically collects the logs from applications/node (/var/pod/log and forward it to elastic search
elastic search which act as a centralized log store and kibana which visualize those logs from elasticsearch.

first deploy elastic search within eks as statefulset application with iam role with service account for dynamically provission the ebs volume,get secrets of it
make sure to install ebs csi (addons) with eksctl create addon --cluser clustername 

then 

install kibana with helm 

then finally

install fluentbit with helm provide the secret here of elastic search bcz it needs to be authenticate with es to forward the logs
