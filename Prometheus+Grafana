what is prometheus:
prometheus is an open source monitoring and alerting tool designed for reliebility and scalability:

Architecture:
so besically prometheus follows pull based architecture where its first component is 

1) prometheus server :
its a central componant & heart of prometheus which besically collect matrix from exporter and stores it in time-series-database(TSD) 

2) Exporter:
exporter is a small program that collects matrix from a system or application and makes them available in a format that prometheus can understand.
we can have n number of exporter but each exporter will be responsible for specific system,service,node 
like for node matrix = node exporter
like for k8s matrix =  kube-state-matrix >> give info about pod health,pod restart,memory,cpu,how many configmap is created,how many secrets,deployment status
similarly we can have so many exporter for specific matrix
we can also have custom matrix

##point  prometheus cannot directly scrap the matrix from system but it rely on exporter (middleman) which collects matrix and expose them via http endpoint(usually /matrix)
and finally prometheus scrap matrix from here

3) Alertmanager :

Sends alerts when something goes wrong. like if cpu goes high or dick space or memory

Can send alerts to Slack, Email, or PagerDuty.

4) Pushgateway (optional)
Used for short-lived jobs that can’t be scraped (like batch jobs).

These jobs push metrics to the Pushgateway, and Prometheus scrapes from it.

5) Promql:
PromQL is the query language used to interact with the Prometheus HTTP server. It allows you to retrieve, filter, and aggregate time-series data.

With PromQL, you can:

🔍 Query metrics based on labels (e.g. method="GET")

📆 Define a time range for your data (like last 5 minutes or 1 hour)

📊 Aggregate data (e.g. sum, avg, rate)

📈 Visualize results as graphs (e.g. in Prometheus UI or Grafana)


q: what is matrix:
matrix is historical data of the events to understand the health of the system
problem with matrix is it is completly raw information (not easy to read)max numerical content

q: how many matrix u have collected
matrix can be collected as followes:
cpu of node utilis
memory
pod status 
deployment status
https request how many in last 30 min
user signed up 
hpa replica


✅ kube-state-metrics
📍 Purpose: Exposes Kubernetes resource states/metadata — not real-time performance.

🟢 Exposes:

Pod status (Running, Pending, Failed)
Pod restart counts (kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total)
Deployment status (kube_deployment_status_*)
Node conditions (kube_node_status_condition)
PVC phase (kube_persistentvolumeclaim_status_phase)
Namespace status
Service spec type (kube_service_spec_type)
ConfigMap info (kube_configmap_info)
Secret info (kube_secret_info)

🖥️ Metrics Endpoint:

http://kube-state-metrics-service:8080/metrics



✅ cAdvisor (Container Advisor)
📍 Purpose: Real-time container-level resource usage metrics, provided by Kubelet.

🟢 Exposes:

CPU & memory consumption (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total, container_memory_usage_bytes)
Filesystem usage (storage per container)
Inode usage (filesystem metadata)
Container uptime
Labels/metadata (container name, image, start time, ID)

🖥️ Metrics Endpoint:

http://<nodeIP>:4194/metrics


✅ node-exporter
📍 Purpose: Node-level system metrics — CPU, disk, memory, etc.

cpu and memory 
filesystem (mounted file system size and usage
process no.of running/sleeping 
uptime how long the node is running

🖥️ Metrics Endpoint:
http//:node-exporter-service:9100/metrics

now thses above metrics are in raw formate which prometheous understand and scrap it which is not human readable thats y we use promql which agregate it filter it provide
alerting and grafana dashboard for better visualisation.
