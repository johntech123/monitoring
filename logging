EFK (ELASTIC SEARCH + FLUENTBIT + KIBANA)

SO we have deployed fluntbit as daemonset in each node which besically collects the logs from applications/node (/var/pod/log and forward it to elastic search
elastic search which act as a centralized log store and kibana which visualize those logs from elasticsearch.

first deploy elastic search within eks as statefulset application with iam role with service account for dynamically provission the ebs volume,get secrets of it
make sure to install ebs csi (addons) with eksctl create addon --cluser clustername 

then 

install kibana with helm 

then finally

install fluentbit with helm provide the secret here of elastic search bcz it needs to be authenticate with es to forward the logs




EFK on vm

first install dependencies
then install elastic search
modify
sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
network.host: 0.0.0.0   bcz by defsoult it expose on local host 0.0.0.0 means everywhere
discovery.type: single-node   add this in descovery block
sudo systemctl restart es

then 
install kibana
sudo apt install -y kibana
sudo nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
server.host: "0.0.0.0"
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
sudo systemctl enable kibana
sudo systemctl start kibana
http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:5601                       make sure to allow inbound rule as 5601,9200

finally 
install fluentbit

curl -s https://packages.fluentbit.io/fluentbit.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.fluentbit.io/ubuntu/focal focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fluentbit.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y fluent-bit

sudo nano /etc/fluent-bit/fluent-bit.conf

    Index         fluentbit
    Logstash_Format On

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart fluent-bit
sudo systemctl status fluent-bit

jenkins master slave architecture
install es and kibana in dedicated vm seprately and install fluentbit in each node 
modify fluentbit properly input, output and filter


go to kibana http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:5601
discover> create index> give name logstash-* thats it
