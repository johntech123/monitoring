what is prometheus:
prometheus is an open source monitoring and alerting tool designed for reliebility and scalability:

Architecture:
so besically prometheus follows pull based architecture where its first component is 

1) prometheus server :
its a central componant & heart of prometheus which besically collect matrix from exporter and stores it in time-series-database(TSD) 

2) Exporter:
exporter is a small program that collects matrix from a system or application and makes them available in a format that prometheus can understand.
we can have n number of exporter but each exporter will be responsible for specific system,service,node 
like for node matrix = node exporter
like for k8s matrix =  kube-state-matrix >> give info about pod health,pod restart,memory,cpu,how many configmap is created,how many secrets,deployment status
similarly we can have so many exporter for specific matrix
we can also have custom matrix

##point  prometheus cannot directly scrap the matrix from system but it rely on exporter (middleman) which collects matrix and expose them via http endpoint(usually /matrix)
and finally prometheus scrap matrix from here

3) Alertmanager :

Sends alerts when something goes wrong. like if cpu goes high or dick space or memory

Can send alerts to Slack, Email, or PagerDuty.

4) Pushgateway (optional)
Used for short-lived jobs that can’t be scraped (like batch jobs).

These jobs push metrics to the Pushgateway, and Prometheus scrapes from it.

5) Promql:
PromQL is the query language used to interact with the Prometheus HTTP server. It allows you to retrieve, filter, and aggregate time-series data.

With PromQL, you can:

🔍 Query metrics based on labels (e.g. method="GET")

📆 Define a time range for your data (like last 5 minutes or 1 hour)

📊 Aggregate data (e.g. sum, avg, rate)

📈 Visualize results as graphs (e.g. in Prometheus UI or Grafana)


q: what is matrix:
matrix is historical data of the events to understand the health of the system
problem with matrix is it is completly raw information (not easy to read)max numerical content

q: how many matrix u have collected
matrix can be collected as followes:
cpu of node utilis
memory
pod status 
deployment status
https request how many in last 30 min
user signed up 
hpa replica
